# Unit 4. Social Network: WoofWise

## Criteria A. Planning
### Problem Description 
I am a dog owner and is involved in many causes on pet care like The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). Through reflection on my digital journal, I noticed that there is a significant issue with stray dogs in the Philippines and around the world, with many animals living in poor conditions and lacking access to proper care and attention. 

Unfortunately, many people who would like to adopt a dog and provide a loving home may not know where to start, or <a style="color: #c74e1a" id="prob3" href="#criteria">may not have access to information about available dogs and local shelters</a>. To add, in the case of pet owners, <a id="prob2" style="color:#eb349b" href="#criteria">although there are multiple sites about pet care, the information for these sites are not coherent and organized</a>. It’s important to also note that <a id='prob1' style="color:orange" href="#criteria">the measures of taking care of pets is different for every dog type and owner, thus there is a need for personalization by allowing users to post about a subject and by allowing interactions with other users with similar experiences or pet breed</a>. In addition to this personalization scheme, <a id="prob4" style="color: #6817a6" href="#criteria">as users may only want to remember certain posts that they might find information for their situation or their pet’s breed, the users should be able to save certain posts that they find significant.</a>

### Rationale for Proposed Solution
As the provided problem focuses on lack of access to information,the proposed solution is a web application. Compared to other alternative solutions such as a mobile application,  a web application enables many users to access the same version of app, to not require app installation, and for users to access the software on various platforms like desktop or mobile. 

The proposed solution is a web application that allows users to post questions/statements, acquire general information on pet care, access a directory of shelters, and save posts that they may resonate/relate to (as pet care varies due to factors like breed, age, and condition).The app is necessary for people who want to make informed decisions regarding their pets, get support from a network of fellow/interested pet owners, and help stray or unadopted animals, as stated in the problem description. 

Python and Flask will be used to develop the web application, along with the three main programming languages commonly used to build a web application, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is optimal to use Python for the development of the application since it's platform independent,that is, one can develop in one operating system and does not have to worry of incompatibility on other operating systems[^9]. Flask will be used for the web app because it is a lightweight framework that can handle multiple requests concurrently, allowing efficiency and fast response times for the users' end. HTML is provides the structure and content of web pages, allowing users to easily navigate and understand the information presented. CSS allows for aesthetic,  making it visually appealing and engaging for users, thus enhancing the overall user experience.  Lastly, SQLite is self-contained relational database management  which will be used due to its simplicity, reliability, and portability allowing for the program and the database to both be localized.

### Design Statement
I will develop a social networking platform in the form of a web application built with Flask, HTML, CSS, Python, and SQLite as the database management engine. This web application will allow both pet owners and potential pet owners to post information or questions about pet care. The web app will include the following features: save post, like/dislike, comment, and sort through posts. It will take about 3 weeks to a month to complete the development of the project and will be evaluated according to a certain success criteria set.   

### <a id="criteria"></a>Criteria for Success 
1. <a style="color:orange" href="#prob1">The web application is a social network where users are able to post about topics and categorize them into “Advice”, “Emotional Support”, “Report”, and “Fluff”</a> 
2. <a style="color: orange" href="#prob1"> The solution should enable users to post, comment on posts, and like posts.</a> 
3. <a style="color:#eb349b" href="#prob2">The solution is a web application and it should show general information about pet care into certain categories: “Health”, “Breeds”, “Grooming”, and “Training”.</a>
4. <a style="color: #c74e1a" href="#prob3">The web app should show a directory of pet shelters. This directory involves the shelter’s name, address, telephone number, email, and contact person.</a>
5. <a style="color: #6817a6" href="#prob4">The web application enables users to bookmark posts and have these bookmarks saved in one page.</a>
6. <a href="#prob2" style="color:#eb349b">The web app allows users to view posts according to the flair(category) the post is in.</a>
