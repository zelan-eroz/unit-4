# Unit 4. Social Network: WoofWise

## Criteria A. Planning
### Problem Description 
I am a dog owner and is involved in many causes on pet care like The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS). I noticed that there is a significant issue with stray dogs in the Philippines and around the world, with many animals living in poor conditions and lacking access to proper care and attention. 

Unfortunately, many people who would like to adopt a dog and provide a loving home may not know where to start, or may not have access to information about available dogs and local shelters. To add, in the case of pet owners, although there are multiple sites about pet care, the information for these sites are not coherent & organized. It’s important to also note that the measures of taking care of pets is different for every dog type and owner, thus there is a need for personalization by allowing users to post about a subject and by allowing interactions with other users with similar experiences or pet breed. In addition to this personalization scheme, as users may only want to remember certain posts that they might find information for their situation or their pet’s breed, the users should be able to save certain posts that they find significant.

### Rationale for Proposed Solution
* ~~Describe the solution (basic)~~
* ~~Describe the solution's features~~
* ~~1 sentence: Rationalize why is this solution (using tech + web app) the best~~
* State the tools to be used during app development. Rationalize why these tools are the best. Do not focus on developer-centric rationales
* The justification of the proposed solution should include the perspective of the client. Why is a Python app adequate to solve the client’s problem?

The proposed solution is a web application that allows users to post questions/statements, acquire general information on pet care, access a directory of shelters, and save posts that they may resonate/relate to (as pet care varies due to factors like breed, age, and condition).The app is necessary for people who want to make informed decisions regarding their pets, get support from a network of fellow/interested pet owners, and help stray or unadopted animals.
As the provided problem focuses on lack of access to information,the solution is a web application as this enables many users to access the same version of app, to not require app installation, and for users to access the software on various platforms like desktop or mobile. 

Python and Flask will be used to develop the web application, along with the three main programming languages commonly used to build a web application, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


### Criteria for Success
1. [the measures of taking care of pets is different for every dog type and owner, thus there is a need for personalization by allowing users to post about a subject and by allowing interactions with other users with similar experiences or pet breed]: The web application is a social network where users are able to post about topics and categorize them into “Advice”, “Emotional Support”, “Report”, and “Fluff”
2. [the measures of taking care of pets is different for every dog type and owner, thus there is a need for personalization by allowing users to post about a subject and by allowing interactions with other users with similar experiences or pet breed]: The solution should enable users to post, comment on posts, and like posts.
3. [although there are multiple sites about pet care, the information for these sites are not coherent]:The solution is a web application and it should show general information about pet care into certain categories: “Health”, “Breeds”, “Grooming”, and “Training”.
4. [may not have access to information about available dogs and local shelters]: The web app should show a directory of pet shelters. This directory involves the shelter’s name, address, telephone number, email, and contact person.
5. [as users may only want to remember certain posts that they might find information for their situation or their pet’s breed, the users should be able to save certain posts that they find significant]: The web application enables users to bookmark posts and have these bookmarks saved in one page.
